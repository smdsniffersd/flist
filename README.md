# flist
it is an analog of the vector class, but using the flar file.h We can choose the type of data storage. 
The array class stores data in a dynamic array format, and the flist class stores data in a doubly linked list format, being the successor of the listbase class. 
The sort1.h file contains sorting methods that sort both types of data.
